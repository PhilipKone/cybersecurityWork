### Chapter 1 - Introduction

#### 1.1 Background of Study

Phishing attacks are among the most persistent and damaging forms of cybercrime. They exploit both technical vulnerabilities and human psychology to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data (Mosa et al., 2023; Opara et al., 2024). These attacks leverage sophisticated emails, websites, and instant messages that impersonate trusted organizations, using tactics such as spoofing, domain squatting, and URL obfuscation to evade detection (Karim et al., 2023; Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023).

The threat landscape has evolved with the emergence of advanced phishing techniques, including spear phishing (targeting specific individuals), whaling (targeting high-profile executives), vishing (voice phishing), and smishing (SMS phishing), all of which expand the attack surface and challenge traditional security solutions (Gholampour & Verma, 2023; Hassan, 2024). Attackers exploit weaknesses in email protocols, browser vulnerabilities, and user behavior, often automating campaigns using readily available phishing kits (Doshi et al., 2023; Al-Subaiey et al., 2024).

Recent years have seen a surge in the use of machine learning and AI by both attackers and defenders, increasing the complexity and sophistication of phishing schemes (Gholampour & Verma, 2023). The proliferation of digital communications and online transactions has amplified the impact of phishing, resulting in significant financial losses, data breaches, and reputational harm (Mosa et al., 2023; Doshi et al., 2023). Phishing remains a leading vector for cyber incidents globally, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive, robust, and scalable detection mechanisms that leverage advanced machine learning techniques (Karim et al., 2023; Linh et al., 2024).

To address these evolving challenges, the development of adaptive phishing detection models is essential. Such models require comprehensive datasets, advanced feature engineering, and the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to emerging threats (Goud & Mathur, 2021; Liu et al., 2021).

#### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite advancements in phishing detection, attackers continuously adapt their tactics, making many existing systems ineffective against new and sophisticated threats. Current limitations include over-reliance on static or outdated datasets, insufficient diversity in feature engineering, and a lack of real-time adaptability. As a result, detection systems often suffer from high false positive rates, limited scalability, and poor generalization to novel phishing strategies. There is a critical need for a robust, adaptive, and data-driven phishing detection approach that leverages comprehensive datasets, advanced feature engineering (including URL, HTML, and behavioral features), and rigorous validation to achieve high accuracy, low false positive rates, and resilience against evolving phishing techniques.

This research seeks to bridge these gaps by systematically integrating state-of-the-art machine learning, diverse and up-to-date datasets, and innovative feature extraction methods to create a scalable and adaptive phishing detection system.

#### 1.3 Objectives

The objectives of this research are:

1. **To develop a machine learning-based phishing detection model using diverse datasets and advanced techniques.**
2. **To design and implement advanced feature engineering methods, including URL, HTML, and behavioral features, and enhance model performance over established baselines.**
3. **To deploy and evaluate the adaptive phishing detection system in a simulated real-time environment, assessing its scalability, adaptability, and response to emerging phishing tactics.**

#### 1.4 Outline of Methodology

This structured methodology ensures the research is actionable, measurable, and directly builds on and extends the state-of-the-art in phishing detection.To achieve these objectives, the research will proceed as follows:

1. **Baseline Replication and Data Preparation:**

   - Acquire the dataset used by Aljofey et al. (2022) and other relevant sources (e.g., PhishTank, Kaggle).
   - Preprocess the data (cleaning, normalization, train/test split).
   - Replicate the feature extraction and baseline model (XGBoost) as described in the base paper to establish a performance benchmark.
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering and Model Enhancement:**

   - Design and implement additional feature extraction methods, including behavioral and language-independent features.
   - Integrate these with URL and HTML features.
   - Train and validate enhanced machine learning models, comparing results to the baseline and targeting measurable improvements in F1-score and accuracy.
3. **Deployment and Real-Time Evaluation:**

   - Deploy the best-performing model in a simulated real-time environment.
   - Measure system scalability, latency, and adaptability to new phishing tactics.
   - Document all findings and ensure all evaluation metrics are met or exceeded.

### Chapter 2 - Literature Review

#### 2.1 Literature Review

Phishing detection research has rapidly evolved, with a diverse array of machine learning and deep learning approaches proposed in recent years. This review synthesizes findings from a broad set of studies, with a focus on the base paper by Aljofey et al. (2022) and how this research aims to extend the state of the art.

**1. Model Development and Validation**

Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for phishing detection. Aljofey et al. (2022) achieved 96.76% accuracy and a 1.39% false positive rate using XGBoost on a large dataset with URL and HTML features. Other works, such as Mosa et al. (2023), explored neural networks and ensemble methods, reporting similar or higher performance. Deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BERT) are increasingly used for both website and email phishing detection (Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023; Hassan, 2024), often exceeding 97% accuracy. However, several authors (Misra & Rayz, 2022; Gholampour & Verma, 2023) stress the importance of model robustness and generalizability, as overfitting to specific datasets can lead to poor real-world performance.

Data diversity and validation strategies are critical. While many studies use public datasets (PhishTank, Kaggle, Enron, etc.), Aljofey et al. (2022) combined benign and phishing samples from multiple sources for a more representative dataset. Recent literature also emphasizes the use of adversarial and out-of-domain samples to test model resilience (Gholampour & Verma, 2023; Opara et al., 2024).

**2. Advanced Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering is central to high-performing phishing detection. Aljofey et al. (2022) found that TF-IDF character-level features from URLs and HTML content were most effective. Other studies incorporate behavioral features, third-party reputation, and email header analysis (Goud & Mathur, 2021; Opara et al., 2024). Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques (recursive feature elimination, genetic algorithms, PCA) are used to optimize performance (Kocyigit et al., 2024; Tanimu et al., 2024).

Despite advances, limitations remain: many systems are language-dependent, struggle with obfuscated or novel content, and require frequent updates to remain effective. This research aims to address these gaps by integrating behavioral and language-independent features.

**3. Deployment and Real-Time Evaluation**

Real-world deployment is a growing focus. Linh et al. (2024) built a browser extension for real-time phishing detection, while Doshi et al. (2023) and Al-Subaiey et al. (2024) evaluated web-based and dual-layer systems for scalability and adaptability. Aljofey et al. (2022) highlighted the need for client-side, real-time detection. Robustness to adversarial attacks and adaptability to new phishing tactics are ongoing challenges (Gholampour & Verma, 2023).

**Summary and Gaps**

The literature shows strong progress in phishing detection, but persistent challenges include dataset diversity, feature robustness, adaptability, and real-world deployment. Building on Aljofey et al. (2022), this research will replicate and extend their approach by incorporating advanced, language-independent, and behavioral features, and by evaluating the system in a simulated real-time environment.
