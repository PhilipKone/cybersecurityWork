### Chapter 1 - Introduction

#### 1.1 Background of Study

Phishing attacks are among the most persistent and damaging forms of cybercrime. They exploit both technical vulnerabilities and human psychology to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data (Mosa et al., 2023; Opara et al., 2024). These attacks leverage sophisticated emails, websites, and instant messages that impersonate trusted organizations, using tactics such as spoofing, domain squatting, and URL obfuscation to evade detection (Karim et al., 2023; Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023).

The threat landscape has evolved with the emergence of advanced phishing techniques, including spear phishing (targeting specific individuals), whaling (targeting high-profile executives), vishing (voice phishing), and smishing (SMS phishing), all of which expand the attack surface and challenge traditional security solutions (Gholampour & Verma, 2023; Hassan, 2024). Attackers exploit weaknesses in email protocols, browser vulnerabilities, and user behavior, often automating campaigns using readily available phishing kits (Doshi et al., 2023; Al-Subaiey et al., 2024).

Recent years have seen a surge in the use of machine learning and AI by both attackers and defenders, increasing the complexity and sophistication of phishing schemes (Gholampour & Verma, 2023). The proliferation of digital communications and online transactions has amplified the impact of phishing, resulting in significant financial losses, data breaches, and reputational harm (Mosa et al., 2023; Doshi et al., 2023). Phishing remains a leading vector for cyber incidents globally, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive, robust, and scalable detection mechanisms that leverage advanced machine learning techniques (Karim et al., 2023; Linh et al., 2024).

To address these evolving challenges, the development of adaptive phishing detection models is essential. Such models require comprehensive datasets, advanced feature engineering, and the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to emerging threats (Goud & Mathur, 2021; Liu et al., 2021).

Despite the proliferation of machine learning and AI-based solutions, a persistent challenge in phishing detection research is the reliance on static or outdated datasets. Many existing studies use datasets that do not reflect the rapidly evolving tactics of attackers, resulting in models that may perform well in controlled experiments but fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. While this research acknowledges the importance of comprehensive and up-to-date datasets, it specifically addresses the need for advanced feature engineering and real-time adaptability to improve detection accuracy and resilience against emerging phishing threats.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite advancements in phishing detection, attackers continuously adapt their tactics, making many existing systems ineffective against new and sophisticated threats. Current limitations include insufficient diversity in feature engineering and a lack of real-time adaptability. As a result, detection systems often suffer from high false positive rates, limited scalability, and poor generalization to novel phishing strategies. There is a critical need for a robust and adaptive phishing detection approach that leverages advanced feature engineering (including URL, HTML, and behavioral features), and rigorous validation to achieve high accuracy, low false positive rates, and resilience against evolving phishing techniques.

This research seeks to bridge these gaps by systematically integrating state-of-the-art machine learning and feature engineering methods to create a scalable and adaptive phishing detection system.

#### 1.3 Objectives

### Chapter 2 - Literature Review

#### 2.1 Overview

Phishing detection research has rapidly evolved, with a diverse array of traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches proposed in recent years. This review synthesizes findings from a broad set of studies and how this research aims to extend the state of the art.

#### 2.2 Phishing Detection Techniques

##### 2.2.1 Preprocessing Techniques

Phishing detection systems rely on effective preprocessing techniques to transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis. Common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and transformation. Data cleaning involves removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values to ensure a high-quality dataset (Mosa et al., 2023). Normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling and z-score normalization, are used to standardize feature values, improving the performance of machine learning algorithms (Aljofey et al., 2022).

Feature extraction methods, including TF-IDF and word embeddings, convert textual data into numerical vectors that capture semantic information (Karim et al., 2023). URL and HTML content are common data sources, with features like URL length, the presence of special characters, and HTML tag counts being indicative of phishing attempts (Goud & Mathur, 2021).

Recent studies have also explored the use of behavioral features, such as mouse movements and click patterns, as additional inputs for phishing detection models (Opara et al., 2024). These features provide insights into user interactions and can help identify suspicious activities that deviate from normal behavior.

Despite the progress, challenges remain in feature generalization and the ability to detect novel phishing tactics. Many existing systems struggle with obfuscated or dynamically generated content, highlighting the need for continuous adaptation and learning in phishing detection models (Gholampour & Verma, 2023).

##### 2.2.2 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is critical in developing effective phishing detection systems, as it directly impacts model performance and generalization. Traditional feature engineering approaches have focused on static attributes, such as URL characteristics and HTML content. However, these features can be easily mimicked or obfuscated by attackers, limiting their effectiveness in detecting sophisticated phishing attempts (Aljofey et al., 2022).

Recent research has started to address these limitations by incorporating behavioral and dynamic features into phishing detection models. Behavioral features, such as mouse movements, click patterns, and typing dynamics, capture user interaction patterns that are difficult for attackers to replicate (Goud & Mathur, 2021). Dynamic features, including real-time content changes and script execution patterns, provide additional context that can help identify suspicious activities (Opara et al., 2024).

The integration of behavioral and dynamic features is still in its early stages, with few studies exploring their full potential. Initial findings are promising, showing that these features can improve detection accuracy and reduce false positive rates (Mosa et al., 2023). However, challenges remain in effectively capturing, modeling, and validating these features in real-world scenarios.

###### 2.2.2.1 Justification for Behavioral and Dynamic Features

While traditional phishing detection systems have achieved high accuracy using static features such as URL characteristics and HTML content, recent literature and empirical results highlight persistent limitations with this approach. The base paper by Aljofey et al. (2022) and several subsequent studies demonstrate that models relying solely on static features are vulnerable to evasion by sophisticated attackers who can mimic or obfuscate these attributes. Furthermore, static analysis may fail when phishing sites employ dynamic content loading, JavaScript obfuscation, or embed critical information in images, making detection more challenging.

To address these gaps, researchers have increasingly advocated for the integration of behavioral and dynamic features into phishing detection frameworks. Behavioral features capture user interaction patterns—such as mouse movements, click sequences, time spent on page elements, and form submission behaviors—that are difficult for attackers to replicate convincingly. Dynamic features may also include real-time content changes, script execution patterns, or feedback signals from user actions. These features provide a new dimension of information, enabling detection systems to identify suspicious activity that static analysis alone may miss.

Although the adoption of behavioral features is still emerging in the literature, several works (e.g., Goud & Mathur, 2021; Opara et al., 2024) have demonstrated their potential to improve model robustness, reduce false positives, and enhance adaptability to novel phishing tactics. The integration of such features is also frequently recommended as a future direction in comprehensive reviews and is recognized as a means to achieve real-world, scalable, and adaptive phishing detection.

Recent studies from 2023–2025 have provided concrete examples and empirical evidence for the value of behavioral features in phishing detection. For instance, Omar et al. (2023) proposed a model that combines literal and behavioral features, achieving high accuracy (up to 99.7%) using machine learning classifiers. Naswir et al. (2022) benchmarked both email structure and human (stylometric) behavior features, finding that combining these domains improved classification accuracy to 98%. Gallo et al. (2024) analyzed user behavior when reading emails, revealing how cognitive vulnerabilities and decision-making are triggered by specific email features. Baltuttis & Teubner (2024) used eye-tracking to show that visual risk indicators significantly influence user trust and response behavior. On the blockchain side, Zheng et al. (2023) and Ghosh et al. (2023) demonstrated that modeling transaction evolution and temporal behaviors can enhance phishing detection in cryptocurrency networks. Timko et al. (2025) further explored how user behavior and demographics affect SMS phishing detection, providing new insights into human factors and detection accuracy.

These recent works reinforce the importance of integrating behavioral and dynamic features, not only for improved detection performance but also for understanding the human factors that influence phishing susceptibility. Their findings support the direction of this research and highlight the growing consensus in the field regarding the value of behavioral analytics.

###### 2.2.2.2 Literature Gap: Behavioral Features

A comprehensive review of recent phishing detection literature (see `research_articles_comprehensive.md`) reveals that behavioral or user interaction features—such as mouse movement, click patterns, or dwell time—are not explicitly implemented or discussed in the surveyed papers. While several studies highlight the limitations of static features (e.g., URL, HTML, or text content) and recommend the exploration of more dynamic or adaptive approaches, none provide concrete examples or evaluations of behavioral feature engineering. This gap underscores the novelty and potential impact of incorporating behavioral/user interaction analytics into phishing detection systems, as proposed in this research.

Updated Literature Gap: Behavioral Features
While earlier reviews noted a lack of concrete implementation of behavioral features in phishing detection, recent studies (2022–2025) have begun to address this gap. For example, Omar et al. (2023), Naswir et al. (2022), and Gallo et al. (2024) have implemented and evaluated behavioral and human-centric features, demonstrating their value for improving detection accuracy and understanding user susceptibility. However, the field is still evolving: many studies focus on specific behavioral aspects (e.g., transaction patterns, gaze tracking, stylometric cues) and often in controlled or domain-specific settings (e.g., blockchain, email, SMS). Comprehensive, real-world integration of diverse behavioral features remains limited, and challenges such as scalability, generalizability, and real-time adaptability are ongoing. This research aims to advance the state of the art by systematically engineering, integrating, and evaluating a broad set of behavioral and dynamic features in a unified, adaptive phishing detection framework.

##### 2.2.3 Machine Learning Algorithms

The choice of machine learning algorithm is pivotal in phishing detection system performance. Aljofey et al. (2022) employed XGBoost, a decision-tree-based ensemble algorithm, which has shown strong performance in various classification tasks. XGBoost's success is attributed to its ability to handle imbalanced data, its robustness to overfitting, and its efficient implementation of gradient boosting (Chen & Guestrin, 2016).

Other studies have explored a range of machine learning algorithms for phishing detection, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Mosa et al., 2023; Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023). Each algorithm has its strengths and limitations, and their performance can vary based on the feature set and the specific characteristics of the phishing attacks.

This research will evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including those used in the base paper and other state-of-the-art approaches, to identify the most effective methods for phishing detection in real-world scenarios. The evaluation will consider not only accuracy but also other factors such as model interpretability, training time, and scalability.

##### 2.2.4 Model Development and Validation

Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for phishing detection. Aljofey et al. (2022) achieved 96.76% accuracy and a 1.39% false positive rate using XGBoost on a large dataset with URL and HTML features. Other works, such as Mosa et al. (2023), explored neural networks and ensemble methods, reporting similar or higher performance. Deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BERT) are increasingly used for both website and email phishing detection (Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023; Hassan, 2024), often exceeding 97% accuracy. However, several authors (Misra & Rayz, 2022; Gholampour & Verma, 2023) stress the importance of model robustness and generalizability, as overfitting to specific datasets can lead to poor real-world performance.

Data diversity and validation strategies are critical. While many studies use public datasets (PhishTank, Kaggle, Enron, etc.), Aljofey et al. (2022) combined benign and phishing samples from multiple sources for a more representative dataset. Recent literature also emphasizes the use of adversarial and out-of-domain samples to test model resilience (Gholampour & Verma, 2023; Opara et al., 2024).

### Summarized Behavioral Features from Recent Literature

Recent studies have identified and utilized a variety of behavioral features for phishing detection, including:

- User interaction patterns: mouse movements, click sequences, dwell time on page elements, and form submission behaviors (Goud & Mathur, 2021; Opara et al., 2024; Gallo et al., 2024).
- Visual attention and gaze patterns: measured via eye-tracking to assess trust and response to risk indicators (Baltuttis & Teubner, 2024).
- Stylometric and cognitive features: lexical, syntactic, structural, and idiosyncratic cues in user-generated content or responses (Naswir et al., 2022).
- Transactional and temporal behaviors: transaction evolution graphs, time-sliced activity, and temporal features in blockchain networks (Zheng et al., 2023; Ghosh et al., 2023).
- Demographic and psychological factors: risk-taking attitudes, decision-making styles, and demographic influences on phishing susceptibility (Timko et al., 2025; Abroshan et al., 2021).
- Response times and decision patterns: how quickly and confidently users interact with suspicious content (Gallo et al., 2024).

These features provide a richer context for distinguishing phishing from legitimate activity and are increasingly recognized as essential for robust, adaptive detection systems.

### Empirical Results from Recent Studies on Behavioral Features

Recent literature provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral features in phishing detection:

- Omar et al. (2023) achieved an average accuracy of 99.7% using models that combined behavioral and literal features.
- Naswir et al. (2022) reported up to 98% accuracy when combining email and human behavior (stylometric) features, outperforming previous benchmarks.
- Zheng et al. (2023) and Ghosh et al. (2023) demonstrated that incorporating temporal and transactional behavioral features in blockchain phishing detection led to significant improvements in recall and F1-score (up to 98%).
- Timko et al. (2025) found that user behavior and demographic factors influenced SMS phishing detection, with detection accuracy of 67.1% for fake messages and 43.6% for real messages, highlighting the complexity of human factors.
- Baltuttis & Teubner (2024) and Gallo et al. (2024) provided qualitative and quantitative insights into how behavioral cues (e.g., gaze, response time) affect user susceptibility and detection outcomes.

These results underscore the value of behavioral features for improving detection accuracy, robustness, and adaptability across different phishing contexts.
