### Chapter 1 - Introduction

#### 1.1 Background of Study

Phishing attacks are among the most persistent and damaging forms of cybercrime, exploiting both technical vulnerabilities and human psychology to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data ([Mosa et al., 2023](#mosa2023); [Opara et al., 2024](#opara2024)). These attacks leverage sophisticated emails, websites, and instant messages that impersonate trusted organizations, using tactics such as spoofing, domain squatting, and URL obfuscation to evade detection ([Karim et al., 2023](#karim2023); [Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023](#atawneh2023)).

The threat landscape has evolved with the emergence of advanced phishing techniques, including spear phishing (targeting specific individuals), whaling (targeting high-profile executives), vishing (voice phishing), and smishing (SMS phishing), all of which expand the attack surface and challenge traditional security solutions ([Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023); [Hassan, 2024](#hassan2024)). Attackers exploit weaknesses in email protocols, browser vulnerabilities, and user behavior, often automating campaigns using readily available phishing kits ([Doshi et al., 2023](#doshi2023); Al-Subaiey et al., 2024).

Recent years have seen a surge in the use of machine learning and AI by both attackers and defenders, increasing the complexity and sophistication of phishing schemes ([Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023)). The proliferation of digital communications and online transactions has amplified the impact of phishing, resulting in significant financial losses, data breaches, and reputational harm ([Mosa et al., 2023](#mosa2023); [Doshi et al., 2023](#doshi2023)). Phishing remains a leading vector for cyber incidents globally, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive, robust, and scalable detection mechanisms that leverage advanced machine learning techniques ([Karim et al., 2023](#karim2023); Linh et al., 2024).

To address these evolving challenges, the development of adaptive phishing detection models is essential. Such models require comprehensive datasets, advanced feature engineering, and the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to emerging threats (Goud & Mathur, 2021; [Liu et al., 2021](#liu2021)).

#### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite notable progress in phishing detection, phishing attacks continue to evolve and evade existing defenses due to limitations such as reliance on outdated or narrow datasets ([Alzubaidi et al., 2021](#alzubaidi2021); Gupta & Nayak, 2020), insufficient integration of diverse features—including URL, HTML, and behavioral characteristics (Wang et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021), and machine learning models that often suffer from high false positive rates and poor adaptability to new threats (Jain & Rahman, 2020; [Alzubaidi et al., 2021](#alzubaidi2021)). These challenges result in detection systems that are neither robust nor scalable enough to address the dynamic and sophisticated nature of modern phishing attacks. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive, machine learning-based approach that leverages diverse datasets, advanced feature engineering, and rigorous evaluation to significantly improve detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and ensure adaptability to emerging phishing techniques.

Addressing these challenges requires a systematic approach that integrates preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, machine learning optimization, and user feedback integration ([Alzubaidi et al., 2021](#alzubaidi2021); Wang et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021). This research aims to bridge these gaps by proposing an adaptive phishing detection model that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to improve detection accuracy and efficiency, as highlighted in recent literature (Jain & Rahman, 2020; [Alzubaidi et al., 2021](#alzubaidi2021)).

#### 1.3 Objectives

The objectives of this research are as follows:

1. **To develop and validate a machine learning-based phishing detection model that achieves at least 95% accuracy and a false positive rate below 3% on benchmark and real-world datasets.**

2. **To design and implement advanced feature engineering methods—including URL, HTML, and behavioral features—demonstrating a measurable improvement (minimum 5% increase in F1-score) over baseline models.**

3. **To deploy and evaluate the adaptive phishing detection system in a simulated real-time environment, measuring scalability and adaptability to new phishing tactics, with successful completion of all evaluation metrics.**

#### 1.4 Outline of Methodology

The methodology for this research is designed to systematically achieve the stated objectives through the following steps:

1. **Model Development and Validation:** Collect and preprocess comprehensive phishing and legitimate datasets from both benchmark and real-world sources. Train a machine learning-based phishing detection model and rigorously validate its performance, targeting at least 95% accuracy and a false positive rate below 3%.

2. **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Design and implement advanced feature extraction methods, including URL, HTML, and behavioral features. Evaluate the impact of these features on model performance, aiming for a minimum 5% improvement in F1-score over baseline models.

3. **Deployment and Real-Time Evaluation:** Deploy the adaptive phishing detection system in a simulated real-time environment. Assess the system’s scalability and adaptability to new phishing tactics, ensuring all evaluation metrics are successfully met.

This methodology ensures a structured and outcome-driven approach to developing a robust, accurate, and adaptive phishing detection solution.

### Chapter 2 - Literature Review

#### 2.1 Literature Review

Phishing detection research has rapidly evolved, with a diverse array of machine learning and deep learning approaches proposed in recent years. This review synthesizes findings from a broad set of studies, organized around the three core objectives of this research: model development and validation, advanced feature engineering, and deployment with real-time evaluation.

**1. Model Development and Validation**

Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various machine learning and deep learning models for phishing detection. For instance, [Mosa et al., 2023](#mosa2023) compared Neural Networks, Naïve Bayes, and Adaboost, achieving up to 95.43% accuracy, while [Karim et al., 2023](#karim2023) introduced a hybrid voting-based model that reached 99.55% accuracy with third-party features. Deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, and BERT have also shown high performance in email phishing detection ([Atawneh & Aljehani, 2023](#atawneh2023); [Hassan, 2024](#hassan2024)), with accuracies exceeding 97%. The use of ensemble and hybrid models is a recurring theme, as seen in [Doshi et al., 2023](#doshi2023) and Chinta et al., 2025, who report F1-scores above 99% using dual-layer and BERT-LSTM architectures, respectively. However, studies such as [Misra & Rayz, 2022](#misra2022) and [Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023) highlight the importance of robustness and generalizability, noting that models can overfit to specific datasets and suffer performance drops on out-of-domain or adversarial samples.

Data diversity and validation strategies are critical. Many works utilize publicly available datasets (e.g., PhishTank, Kaggle, Enron, SpamAssassin), but others aggregate data from multiple sources or generate synthetic/adversarial samples to test model resilience ([Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023); [Opara et al., 2024](#opara2024)). Cross-validation, holdout testing, and comparison with baseline models are standard, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and MCC widely reported (Linh et al., 2024; Aljofey et al., 2022).

**2. Advanced Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering remains a cornerstone of high-performing phishing detection systems. Traditional approaches focus on URL-based features (e.g., length, special characters, domain age), but recent studies incorporate HTML content, email headers, third-party reputation, and behavioral signals (Goud & Mathur, 2021; Aljofey et al., 2022; [Opara et al., 2024](#opara2024)). Recursive feature elimination, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis are employed to select the most relevant features and reduce dimensionality (Kocyigit et al., 2024; Tanimu et al., 2024).

Several studies demonstrate that advanced feature engineering can yield measurable improvements in model performance. For example, Yang et al., 2021 and [Liu et al., 2021](#liu2021) integrate surface, topological, and deep features, reporting improved detection accuracy and faster training times. Swapna Goud & Mathur, 2021 and Wazirali et al., 2021 show that optimal feature selection enhances both accuracy and computational efficiency. However, limitations remain regarding feature generalizability, computational cost, and the need for frequent updates to counter evolving phishing tactics ([Mehdi Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023); Al-Subaiey et al., 2024).

**3. Deployment and Real-Time Evaluation**

Real-world deployment and real-time evaluation are increasingly emphasized in the literature. Linh et al., 2024 developed a browser extension for real-time URL classification using CNNs, achieving 98.4% accuracy. [Doshi et al., 2023](#doshi2023) and Al-Subaiey et al., 2024 implemented web-based and dual-layer architectures, addressing challenges of scalability and adaptability. Studies such as Purwanto et al., 2022 and [Liu et al., 2021](#liu2021) propose feature-free and multistage detection frameworks for rapid and robust detection in practical environments.

Adversarial robustness and adaptability to new phishing tactics are also explored. [Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023) generated adversarial email samples to test model defenses, while [Opara et al., 2024](#opara2024) and Aljofey et al., 2022 highlight the need for continuous model updates and evaluation on diverse datasets. Despite high reported accuracies, many authors note limitations in scalability, computational requirements, and the risk of performance degradation as phishing techniques evolve ([Mehdi Gholampour & Verma, 2023](#gholampour2023); Linh et al., 2024).

**Summary and Gaps**

The literature demonstrates substantial progress in phishing detection, with high-performing models, advanced feature engineering, and real-world deployments. However, persistent challenges include ensuring dataset diversity, feature robustness, adversarial resilience, and practical scalability. This research builds upon these findings by developing and validating a machine learning-based phishing detection system that leverages advanced feature engineering and is evaluated in both benchmark and real-world scenarios, addressing gaps identified across the reviewed literature.
