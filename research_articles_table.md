|----------|-------------|
| Problem Solved | Addresses the persistent challenge of phishing in email communications by improving detection methods—especially handling the gap between in-domain and out-of-domain emails. |
| Methodology | Adapts pre-trained GPT2 models to the email domain by (a) fine-tuning them on a large corpus of ~725k training emails with a classification objective and (b) employing an in-context priming approach to facilitate zero-shot-like classification. |
| Data & Availability | Aggregated from several well-known sources: legitimate emails from Enron, Avocado, and IWSPA-AP; phishing emails from Nazario, FRAUD, and UNTROUBLED. After rigorous pre-processing and deduplication, about 830k emails are used. The data sources are public, though the final aggregated dataset is not explicitly released. |
| Performance Metrics | The modified language models achieve near-perfect in-domain performance—with MCC scores close to 0.98–0.99—and improved robustness on out-of-domain data (MCC up to 0.84 with the priming approach). Perplexity values improve from ~12 (when trained from scratch) to ~7 (after fine-tuning). |

| Journal | Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics (IWSPA ’23) |
| Publisher | ACM, New York, NY, USA |
| Year | 2023 |

#### Research Details
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Problem Solved | Enhance the robustness of phishing detection models against adversarial attacks and imbalanced datasets |
| Methodology | Generation of adversarial examples using TextAttack techniques (Textfooler, PWWS, DeepWordBug, BAE), fine-tuning GPT-2 for synthetic phishing email generation, and applying a K-Nearest Neighbor defense to correctly reclassify adversarial examples |
| Data & Availability | Utilized the public IWSPA 2.0 phishing/legitimate email dataset (initially composed of 629 phishing and 5092 legitimate emails, later refined), with the augmented adversarial and synthetic datasets publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ReDASers/IWSPA-2023-AdversarialSynthetic-Dataset.git) |
| Performance Metrics | Baseline models achieved approximately 0.99 accuracy with F1 scores around 0.95–0.97; however, under adversarial attacks the F1 score dropped dramatically (in some cases as low as 0.10), while the defensive K-NN approach yielded 94% accuracy for classifying adversarial examples |

#### Additional Information

|----------|-------------|
| Problem Solved | The paper addresses the challenge of detecting phishing websites efficiently, aiming to overcome the drawbacks of slow training and suboptimal detection accuracy in existing methods. |
| Methodology | A novel non-inverse matrix online sequence extreme learning machine (NIOSELM) is proposed. This approach avoids matrix inversion using the Sherman–Morrison Woodbury equation and integrates online sequential learning. In addition, comprehensive features (surface, topological, and deep) are extracted and further refined through data preprocessing modules: ADASYN is used for balancing the imbalanced dataset, and a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) is adopted for dimensionality reduction. |
| Data & Availability | Normal websites are sourced from Alexa’s top 2000 and 58,000 DMOZ websites covering various sectors; phishing websites (5000 examples) are retrieved from PhishTank. Data is collected via a Python-based web crawler, with subsequent processing in MATLAB. |
| Performance Metrics | The experimental results indicate improved detection accuracy and faster training speed compared to other methods, though no specific numerical values are provided in the excerpt. |

#### Additional Information
| Category | Details |
|----------|----------|
| Future Work | The article does not explicitly state future work directions. |
| Limitations | The paper notes that domain and topological features may not be fully captured for all phishing websites due to temporary unavailability. Moreover, some steps (e.g., reliance on synthetic data via ADASYN) might introduce dependency on parameter tuning. |
| Critique | While the method shows promise in improving training speed and detection accuracy, the reliance on multiple preprocessing steps (ADASYN and SDAE) and advanced matrix operations may add complexity when scaling or deploying in real-world environments. |

| Authors | Rizka Widyarini Purwanto, Arindam Pal, Alan Blair, Sanjay Jha |
| Journal | IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security |
| Publisher | IEEE |
| Year | 2022 |
| Volume | 17 |

#### Research Details
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Problem Solved | Effectively detect phishing websites without needing manual feature extraction, even when phishing sites are slight variations of known attacks. |
| Methodology | Uses a feature‐free approach by computing the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) over website HTMLs. The method employs the Furthest Point First algorithm for extracting prototypes from clusters and uses an incremental learning framework to adapt to changes. |
| Data & Availability | Evaluated on a large dataset comprising phishing websites (e.g., reports from PhishTank and manually verified brand-specific cases). The paper does not explicitly state if the dataset is publicly available. |
| Performance Metrics | AUC of 98.68%, TPR of about 90%, FPR of 0.58%, with an average processing time around 0.3 seconds. |

#### Additional Information
| Category | Details |
|----------|----------|
| Future Work | Future work may extend the framework to cover phishing websites with completely novel HTML structures and incorporate additional web content features to enhance robustness. |
| Limitations | The methodology is inherently limited to detecting variations of phishing websites that have previously occurred, potentially missing novel phishing templates with entirely different HTML structures. |
| Critique | While the feature-free, NCD-based approach is elegant and achieves strong performance, it might encounter scalability issues with very large datasets and could benefit from complementing HTML similarity with other features (e.g., dynamic or visual content cues) to handle evolving phishing tactics. |

| Year | 2022 |
| Volume | 12 |
| Issue | 8842 (article number) |

#### Research Details
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Problem Solved | Detect phishing websites that masquerade as legitimate and mitigate risks such as 0-hour attacks and false positives |
| Methodology | Extracts a hybrid set of features including: <br> • URL character sequence features (without relying on phishing prior knowledge)<br>• Textual content features (via character-level TF-IDF from plaintext and noisy HTML)<br>• Various hyperlink features<br>These features are fed into an XGBoost classifier for detection |
| Data & Availability | A custom dataset was built comprising 60,252 webpages (27,280 phishing and 32,972 benign), with testing also performed on a benchmark dataset. |
| Performance Metrics | On the custom dataset: 96.76% accuracy with a 1.39% false positive rate; on the benchmark dataset: 98.48% accuracy with a 2.09% false positive rate |

#### Additional Information
| Category | Details |
|----------|----------|
| Future Work | The paper’s conclusion mentions future work, though detailed plans were not provided in the extracted text. |
| Limitations | • The approach relies on HTML/text-based features which are language-dependent<br>• It requires access to the webpage’s HTML source code |
| Critique | While robust and outperforming several baseline methods, the method’s reliance on HTML content and plain-text extraction may limit its effectiveness if webpage structures change, if content is embedded as images, or in cases of dynamic content modifications. |
