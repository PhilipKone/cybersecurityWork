From the figure, we noticed that the ratios of the external hyperlinks to the internal hyperlinks, and null hyperlinks in the phishing websites are higher than that in benign websites. Whereas, benign sites contain more anchor files, internal hyperlinks, and total hyperlinks.Classification algorithms. To  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  features,  we  have  used  various  machine  learning  classifiers  such  as  eXtreme  Gradient  Boosting  (XGBoost),  Random  Forest,  Logistic  Regres-sion, Naïve Bayes, and Ensemble of Random Forest and Adaboost classifiers to train our proposed approach. The major aim of comparing different classifiers is to expose the best classifier fit for our feature set. To apply differ-ent machine learning classifiers, Scikit-learn.org package is used, and Python is employed for feature extraction. From the empirical results, we noticed that XGBoost outperformed other classifiers. XGBoost algorithm is a type of ensemble classifiers, that transform weak learners to robust ones and convenient for our proposed feature set, thus it has high performance.XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) is a scalable machine learning system for tree boosting proposed by Chen and  Guestrin40. Suppose there are N websites in the dataset {(xi,yi)|i=1,2,...,N} ,  where xi∈Rd is the extracted features associated with the i−th website, yi∈{0,1} is the class label, such that yi=1 if and only if the website is a labelled phishing website.

Moreover, XGBoost provides a number of advantages, some of which include: (i) The strength to handle missing values existing within the training set, (ii) handling huge datasets that do not fit into memory and (iii) For faster computing, XGBoost can make use of multiple cores on the CPU. The websites are classified into two possible categories: phishing and benign using a binary classifier. When a user requests a new site, the trained XGBoost classifier determines the validity of a particular webpage from the created feature vector.Experiments and result analysisIn this section we describe the training and testing dataset, performance metrics, implementation details, and outcomes of our approach. The proposed features described in “Features extraction” section are used to build a binary classifier, which classify phishing and benign websites accurately.Dataset. We  collected  the  dataset  from  two  sources  for  our  experimental  implementation.  The  benign  webpages are collected in February 2020 from Stuff  Gate42, whereas the phishing webpages are collected from  P h i s hTa n k43, which have been validated from August 2016 to April 2020. Our dataset consists of 60,252 web-pages and their HTML source codes, wherein 27,280 ones are phishing and 32,972 ones are benign. Table 3 pro-vides the distribution of the benign and phishing instances. We have divided the dataset into two groups where D1 is our dataset, and D2 is dataset used in existing  literature6. The database management system (i.e., pgAdmin) has been employed with python to import and pre-process the data. The data sets were randomly split in 80:20 ratios for training and testing, respectively.Performance metrics. To measure the performance of proposed anti-phishing approach, we used differ-ent statistical metrics such true-positive rate (TPR), true-negative rate (TNR), false-positive rate (FPR), false-negative rate (FNR), sensitivity or recall, accuracy (Acc), precision (Pre), F-Score, AUC, and they are presented in  Table 4. NB  and  NP  indicate  the  total  number  of  benign  and  phishing  websites,  respectively.  NB→B  are  the  benign websites are correctly marked as benign, NB→P are the benign websites are incorrectly marked as phish-ing, NP→P are the phishing websites are correctly marked as phishing, and NP→B are the phishing websites are incorrectly marked as benign. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) arch and AUC are commonly used to evaluate the measures of a binary classifier. The horizontal coordinate of the ROC arch is FPR, which indicates the probability that the benign website is misclassified as a phishing; the ordinate is TPR, which indicates the probability that the phishing website is identified as a phishing.Evaluation of features. In this section, we evaluated the performance of our proposed features (URL and HTML). We have implemented different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers for feature evaluation used in our approach. In Table 5, we extracted various text features such as TF-IDF word level, TF-IDF N-gram level (the length of n-gram between 2 and 3), TF-IDF character level, count vectors (bag-of-words), word sequences vec-tors, global to vector (GloVe) pre-trained word embedding, trained word embedding, character sequences vec-Table 3.

16Vol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports|         (2022) 12:8842  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10841-5www.nature.com/scientificreports/approach gives TNR that is higher by 4.97%, and FPR that is lesser by 4.96%. Our approach accurately identifies the legitimate websites with a high TNR and low FPR. Some phishing detection methods achieve high recall, however inaccurate classification of the legitimate websites is more serious compared to inaccurate classification of the phishing sites.Discussion and limitationsThe phishing website seems similar to its benign official website, and the defiance is how to distinguish between them. This paper proposed a novel anti-phishing approach, which involves different features (URL, hyperlink, and text) that have never been taken into consideration. The proposed approach is a completely client-side solution. We applied these features on various machine learning algorithms and found that XGBoost attained the best performance. Our major aim is to design a real-time approach, which has a high true-negative rate and low false-positive rate. The results show that our approach correctly filtered the benign webpages with a low amount of benign webpages incorrectly classified as phishing. In the process of phishing webpage classification, we construct the dataset by extracting the relevant and useful features from benign and phishing webpages.A desktop machine having a core™ i7 processor with 3.4 GHz clock speed and 16 GB RAM is used to executed the proposed anti-phishing approach. Since Python provides excellent support of its libraries and has sensible compile-time, the proposed approach is implemented using Python programming language. BeautifulSoup library is employed to parse the HTML of the specified URL. The detection time is the time between entering URL to generating outputs. When the URL is entered as a parameter, the approach attempts to fetch all specific features from the URL and HTML code of the webpage as debated in feature extraction section. This is followed by current URL classification in form of benign or phishing based on the value of the extracted feature. The total execution time of our approach in phishing webpage detection is around 2–3 s, which is quite low and acceptable in a real-time environment. Response time depends on different factors, such as input size, internet speed, and server configuration. Using our data D1, we also attempted to compute the time taken for training, testing and detecting of proposed approach (all feature combinations) for the webpage classification. The results are given in Table 12.In pursuit of a further understanding of the learning capabilities, we also present the classification error as well as log loss regarding the number of iterations implemented by XGBoost. Log loss, short for logarithmic loss is a loss function for classification that indicates the price paid for the inaccuracy of predictions in classification problems. Figure 10 show the logarithmic loss and the classification error of the XGBoost approach for each epoch on the training and test dataset D1. From reviewing the figure, we might note that the learning algorithm is converging after approximately 100 iterations.Limitations. Although our proposed approach has attained outstanding accuracy, it has some limitations. First limitation is that the textual features of our phishing detection approach depend on the English language. This may cause an error in generating efficient classification results when the suspicious webpage includes lan-guage  other  than  English.  About  half  (60.5%)  of  the  websites  use  English  as  a  text  language44.  However,  our  approach  employs  URL,  noisy  part  of  HTML,  and  hyperlink  based  features,  which  are  language-independent  Table 12.

The second limitation is that despite the proposed approach uses URL based features, our approach may fail to identify the phishing websites in case when the phishers use the embedded objects (i.e., Javascript, images, Flash, etc.) to obscure the textual content and HTML coding from the anti-phishing solutions. Many attackers use single server-side scripting to hide the HTML source code. Based on our experiments, we noticed that legiti-mate pages usually contain rich textual content features, and high amount of hyperlinks (At least one hyperlink in the HTML source code). At present, some phishing webpages include malware, for example, a Trojan horse that  installs  on  user’s  system  when  the  user  opens  the  website.  Hence,  the  next  limitation  of  this  approach  is  that it is not sufficiently capable of detecting attached malware because our approach does not read and process content from the web page’s external files, whether they are cross-domain or not. Finally, our approach’s training time is relatively long due to the high dimensional vector generated by textual content features. However, the trained approach is much better than the existing baseline methods in terms of accuracy.Conclusion and future workPhishing website attacks are a massive challenge for researchers, and they continue to show a rising trend in recent years. Blacklist/whitelist techniques are the traditional way to alleviate such threats. However, these meth-ods fail to detect non-blacklisted phishing websites (i.e., 0-day attacks). As an improvement, machine learning techniques are being used to increase detection efficiency and reduce the misclassification ratio. However, some of them extract features from third-party services, search engines, website traffic, etc., which are complicated and difficult to access. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach which can speedily and precisely detect phishing websites using URL and HTML features of the given webpage. The proposed approach is a completely client-side solution, and does not rely on any third-party services. It uses URL character sequence features without expert intervention, and hyperlink specific features that determine the relationship between the content and the URL of a webpage. Moreover, our approach extracts TF-IDF character level features from the plaintext and noisy part of the given webpage’s HTML.A new dataset is constructed to measure the performance of the phishing detection approach, and various classification algorithms are employed. Furthermore, the performance of each category of the proposed feature set is also evaluated. According to the empirical and comparison results from the implemented classification algorithms, the XGBoost classifier with integration of all kinds of features provides the best performance. It acquired 1.39% false-positive rate and 96.76% of overall detection accuracy on our dataset. An accuracy of 98.48% with a 2.09% false-positive rate on a benchmark dataset.In future work, we plane to include some new features to detect the phishing websites that contain malware. As we said in “Limitations” section, our approach could not detect the attached malware with phishing web-page. Nowadays, blockchain technology is more popular and seems to be a perfect target for phishing attacks like phishing scams on the blockchain. Blockchain is an open and distributed ledger that can effectively register transactions between receiving and sending parties, demonstrably and constantly, making it common among  investors45. Thus, detecting phishing scams in the blockchain environment is a defiance for more research and evolution. Moreover, detecting phishing attacks in mobile devices is another important topic in this area due to the popularity of smart  phones47, which has made them a common target of phishing offenses.Data availabilityThe dataset generated during the current study are available in the Google Drive repository: https:// drive. google.com/ file/d/ 18ZZH sCeMm F9HKT aL_ yd41oJ_ 3Fgk0 gWE/ view? usp= shari ng.Received: 17 December 2021; Accepted: 6 April 2022References  1.
